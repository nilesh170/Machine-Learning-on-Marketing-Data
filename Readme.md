## Problem

This case requires to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Here, we have to divide the data into distinctive groups, the process is known as "marketing segmentation" and it's crucial for maximizing bank's marketing campaign conversion rate.

### K-means

- Kmeans algorithm is an unsupervised learning iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. 
- It tries to make the intra-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different as possible. 
- The algorithm groups observations with similar attribute values together by measuring the Euclidian Distance between points.

### PCA

- PCA is a unsupervised ML algorithm.
- PCA performs dimensionality reductions while attempting at keeping the original information unchanged.
